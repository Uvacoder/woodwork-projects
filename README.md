The [plans folder](plans/) contains the desigs for some of my woodworking
projects.

The [gallery folder](gallery/) contains a more extensive selection of projects,
as a lot of the time I build things without a digital plan, or use plans
published by others (in the latter case I'm including link to people whose
plans I used).

Finally, the [howto folder](howto) contains a few useful tips & tricks.
