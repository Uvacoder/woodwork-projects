This folder contains plans for woodworking projects which I designed, mostly
for building out of plywood. I build many other things either using plans
others have published, or simply winging it. For a gallery of selected projects,
see the [gallery folder](gallery/).

The plans are provided as .stl files for [Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/),
and many newer plans also come with a cutlist in PDF format, created with
(CutList Optimizer)[https://www.cutlistoptimizer.com], which is a great help
in figuring out an efficient way to get the most out of your plywood. I don't
always follow the cutlist 100%, but it is always very helpful to look at the
generated cutlist to get an idea for an approach.
