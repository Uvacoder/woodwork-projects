The [plans folder](plans/) contains the plans for some of my woodworking
projects. I'm uploading plans that are 'generic' and could be helpful to /
reused by other woodworkers.

I have of course
built many other things either using plans published by others, or simply by
winging it. For a more extensive selection of projects, see the [gallery
folder](gallery/).

Finally, the [methods folder](methods) contains a few useful tips & tricks.
