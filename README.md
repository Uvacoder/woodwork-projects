This folder contains the plans for some of my woodworking projects. I'm
uploading plans that are 'generic' and could be helpful to / reused by other
woodworkers (as opposed to my more custom / one-off plans).

I have of course
built many other things either using plans published by others, or simply by
winging it. For a more extensive selection of projects, see the [gallery
folder](gallery/).

My plans are provided as .stl files for [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/).
I use the free web-based version, which works well for my needs.

I build most of my projects out of plywood and some of my newer plans also come
with a cutlist in PDF format, created with [CutList
Optimizer](https://www.cutlistoptimizer.com). Computer-generated cutlists are a
great help in quickly figuring out an efficient way to cut and to get the most
out of your plywood panels. I don't always follow the cutlist 100%, but it is
always very helpful to look at the generated cutlist to get an idea for an
approach.
