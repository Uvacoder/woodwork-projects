The [plans folder](plans/) contains the desigs for some of my
woodworking projects.

I have built many other things either using plans published by others, or
simply by winging it. The [gallery folder](gallery/) contains a more extensive
selection of projects.

Finally, the [howto folder](howto) contains a few useful tips & tricks.
