The [plans folder](plans/) contains my woodworking designs.

The [gallery folder](gallery/) contains a more extensive selection of projects,
as a lot of the time I build things without a plan, or use plans published by
others (in the latter case I'm including link to the plans I used).

Finally, the [howto folder](howto) contains a few useful tips & tricks.
