This folder contains plans for woodworking projects which I designed, mostly
for building out of plywood. I build many other things either using plans
others have published, or simply winging it. For a gallery of projects,
see IG.

The plans are provided as .stf files for [Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/),
and newer plans also come with a cutlist in PDF format, which was created with
(CutList Optimizer)[https://www.cutlistoptimizer.com], which is a great help
in figuring out an efficient way to get the most out of your lumber. I don't
always follow the cutlist 100%, but it is always very helpful to look at the
generated cutlist.
