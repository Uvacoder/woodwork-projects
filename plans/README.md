The plans are provided as .stl files for [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/).
I use the free web-based version, which works well for my needs.

I build most of my projects out of plywood and some of my newer plans also come
with a cutlist in PDF format, created with [CutList
Optimizer](https://www.cutlistoptimizer.com). Computer-generated cutlists are a
great help in quickly figuring out an efficient way to cut and get the most
out of your plywood panels. I don't always follow the cutlist 100%, but it is
always very helpful to look at the generated cutlist to get an idea for an
approach.

I buy full sheets of plywood (4' x 8'), but I usually break them down to three
equal-sized pieces for easy transport (ie. 3 panels of 32" x 48"). Most
cutlists provided reflect this smaller panel sizze, except when boards longer
than 4' are required (eg. the [long shelves](longshelves/) ).
