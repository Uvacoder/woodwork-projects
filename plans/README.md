The plans are provided as .stl files for [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/).
I use the free web-based version.

I build most of my projects out of plywood and some of my newer plans also come
with a cutlist in PDF format, created with [CutList
Optimizer](https://www.cutlistoptimizer.com). Computer-generated cutlists are a
great help in quickly figuring out an efficient way to cut and get the most
out of your plywood panels, even if you don't always follow the cutlist 100%.
